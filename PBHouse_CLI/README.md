# Fantasy Tavern Maker
***For Fantasy Worlds Settings such as Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition***

## Current Version

1.0.0

## Purpose 

Most Games Masters or Authors are aware that they need to unique and 
interesting Pubs, Taverns, Inns, Wayhouses and the like as part of the 
adventure-travel narrative. However, it can be awkward to do so easily 
on-the-fly without complex table rolling that interrupts the flow of the story.

Based on a few ideas I had  I decided to put together a simple DOT-Net / 
C-Sharp application that would quickly handle this job.

The local Pub and Bed House for travellers is the the Summer Hen. The Modest-quality 
establishment would be considered tiny, with 6 tables. It has 3 hammocks in the 
common room and 0 private rooms. Rooms are 5sp per day, and meals are 3sp per day.

As you enter, you smell tobacco and foods cooking. It seems to be a subdued place, 
evenly lit by oil lamps. A sign just outside the door says '(colorful names of prior guests)'.

The menu has the usual standard fare posted. The House Specialty Drink is an 
imported Red Wine, for 7 copper, while the House Specialty Meal is fermented 
pheasant, served with roasted forest nuts, for 6 copper.
